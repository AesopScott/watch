# Polaris

Scott's personal AI command center — parallel agent sessions, real API control, Electron desktop UI.

## Session startup
Run `gh repo set-default AesopScott/polaris` at the start of every session before using any `gh` commands. The session worktree is already a linked git repo — run this from the current working directory, no `cd` required.

## Critical rules
1. **Propose before writing.** For file edits and writes, state the planned change and wait for explicit yes. Reads, searches, and tool calls proceed without asking.
2. **Three zones:** Source (`C:\Users\scott\Code\Polaris`) — edit only here, requires `npm run dist` rebuild. Installed app (`C:\Users\scott\AppData\Local\Programs\Polaris\resources`) — only touch with explicit approval. Runtime data (`C:\Users\scott\AppData\Roaming\.claude\polaris\`, the user's `Downloads` folder, and `G:\*`) — only places for runtime reads/writes.
3. **Versioning:** state file's current version before editing, new version after. Versions in `%APPDATA%\.claude\polaris\file-versions.json`.
4. **Locks:** check `locks.json` before any write; locked files need explicit approval.
5. **Server restarts:** never from code — tell Scott.
6. **Windows:** Use PowerShell or Node `fs` for file operations. When `gh` or `git` must run in Bash, use forward-slash paths (`C:/Users/scott/Code/Polaris`) — backslash paths silently corrupt in bash and will fail.
7. **Commit after every change:** After any file edit or write, immediately commit with a conventional message (feat, fix, refactor, docs, chore, perf, ci). Never leave changes uncommitted. Bump `package.json` version **at delivery time** — in the same edit as the code change, not retroactively, not at end of session, not when the build runs.
8. **Never give up after one tool failure.** If `QueryMemory` returns an error or empty content, fall back to `Read`, `Glob`, or `Grep` against the filesystem — do not stop and ask the user. Canonical paths to try first: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Polaris\CLAUDE.md` (project rules) and `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Polaris_Build\1-Soul.md` through `8-Logs.md` (project knowledge base, listed in detail under "Project knowledge base" below). Bash and PowerShell tools are available — use them. Asking the user to "advise" or "provide the path" is a last resort, not a first response.
9. **Config archives.** Every write to `%APPDATA%\.claude\polaris\config.json` auto-copies the prior content to `%APPDATA%\.claude\polaris\config-archive\config.<ISO>.json`. Append-only, capped at 200 files / 10 MB total — oldest pruned first. If a save corrupts or wipes config (the 2026-05-05 incident wiped `obsidianDir`, MCP servers, and routines from every project), restore from the most recent pre-incident archive. Do not trust `config.backup.json` alone — single-level, gets rotated past loss points.
10. **Never run the installer without explicit approval.** Running `build-install.ps1` or any `dist` build launches an NSIS installer that can trigger a Windows reboot. Always ask Scott before running any build+install command. Building with `npm start` or `npm run pack` is safe (no installer, no reboot risk).
11. **Project isolation.** Do not read files, inspect git history, or browse the directory structure of any other project directory without explicit approval from Scott. Cross-project access is permitted only when Scott explicitly names the other project in the request.
12. **JSON file encoding (Windows).** Never use the Edit tool to modify `config.json`, `backlog.json`, or any JSON files with multi-byte string content. The Edit tool on Windows can corrupt UTF-8 by saving with wrong encoding (smart quotes, em-dashes, etc. become mojibake). Instead: use `node -e` with `JSON.parse()` / `JSON.stringify()` and explicit `utf8` encoding. This applies to all JSON files with non-ASCII content. Affected files: `%APPDATA%\.claude\polaris\config.json`, `docs/backlog.json`, `docs/backlog-archive.json`.
13. **Branch gate (multi-session).** When the orchestrator is active (`%APPDATA%\.claude\polaris\session-guidance\orchestrator-active.json` shows `"active": true`), no session may execute a branch or worktree operation without first submitting a request to `branch-requests.json` in that directory and receiving an `"approved"` response. The orchestrator is the sole resolution authority for all branch conflicts and may approve or deny any op autonomously. Scott's direct "yes" overrides the gate at any time. See the global CLAUDE.md orchestrator gate rule for the full request/response protocol.
14. **Session directives (multi-session).** On every session startup and on each tick, read `%APPDATA%\.claude\polaris\session-guidance\session-directives.json` and process any pending entries where `target.sessionId` matches this session or `target.branch` matches the current branch. Process in priority order: `critical` → `high` → `normal`. Set `status: "acknowledged"` before acting, then `status: "completed"` or `"failed"` after. Use `node -e` with utf8 for all reads and writes — never the Edit tool or PowerShell JSON cmdlets. This file must be listed as an exception in `locks.json` before the directive system is considered active.
15. **Skill sync requirement.** Anytime a skill is created or modified in `~/.claude/commands/`, it MUST be synced to `docs/skills/` to keep documentation current. The sync is a direct file copy (e.g., `cp ~/.claude/commands/skill-name.md docs/skills/skill-name.md`). This maintains `~/.claude/commands/` as the source of truth and `docs/skills/` as the documentation mirror. After syncing, commit with message: `docs: sync skill {name} to docs/skills/`.

## Architecture
- **Agent sessions** → Direct OpenRouter API (`POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`, OpenAI streaming format). Implemented in `runDirectAgent()` in server.js. Rolling 20-turn message window. Tool schemas executed natively in server.js: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, PowerShell, WebFetch, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion, TodoWrite, QueryMemory, SetProject, **SetStatus**. System prompt = BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT + CLAUDE.md + project memory. No CLI involved.
- **Chat sessions** → Claude Max plan via Claude CLI (`spawnMaxChat`). Uses Claude Code's native tool set only. **SetStatus is NOT a Claude Code tool — do not attempt to call it in chat sessions.** Polaris auto-detects session card state from your final message: end with "Please test this" or "Try it out" → purple test card; end with "?" → amber waiting card; otherwise → green done. For agent sessions, you can also use SetStatus("hold") for a manual yellow hold state.
- **Routine sessions** → DeepSeek direct API (`api.deepseek.com`) via `spawnDeepSeekRoutine()`. Single-turn, no tools.
- Never mix routing. The old Claude CLI path (`spawnClaude`) is retained in server.js but no longer called.

## Key files
- `server.js` — HTTP+WS server; agent/chat spawning, file versioning, lock enforcement.
- `main.js` — Electron entry; forks server.js, creates BrowserWindow.
- `resources/mockup.html` — source UI; copied to AppData on first run.
- `scripts/build-install.ps1` — one-shot build + install. Use this instead of running `npm run dist` and the installer manually.
- `scripts/prune-dist.js` — keeps last 5 `dist/Polaris Setup *.exe` (auto-runs via `postdist` / `postdist:fast` hooks).
- `%APPDATA%\.claude\polaris\config.json` — API keys, model strings, vault path, all settings.

## Build & install
- **One-shot:** `& C:\Users\scott\Code\Polaris\scripts\build-install.ps1` — runs `dist:fast`, then launches the newest `dist\Polaris Setup *.exe`. Use this for Scott's daily reinstall loop.
- **Speed ladder (when you need a different mode):**
  - `npm start` — instant; runs Electron directly, no build, no install
  - `npm run pack` — unpacked `dist/win-unpacked/Polaris.exe`, no installer
  - `npm run dist:fast` — NSIS installer with `compression=store` and `asar=false` (~3-5x faster than `dist`)
  - `npm run dist` — full release NSIS (LZMA + asar)
- Old installers auto-pruned to 5 most recent. To keep more, edit `KEEP` in `scripts/prune-dist.js`.
- Windows Defender exclusions for the source dir, `dist/`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Polaris` cut Electron build time 30-50% — set manually in Windows Security.

## Changelog maintenance (mandatory after every version bump)
After bumping `package.json` version, prepend a row to the **Build Index** table at the top of `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Polaris_Build\4-Changelog.md`. Newest build at the top of the table.

**Format:** `| <version> | <YYYY-MM-DD> | **<type>:** <multi-sentence description with markdown> |`

- `<type>` is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `perf`, `test`, `ci` — bolded with `**type:**` prefix
- Description is 2-6 sentences explaining **what landed AND why** (root cause for fixes, scope for features). Single-sentence headlines are too thin — they don't survive context loss
- Use backticks around filenames (`mockup.html`, `server.js`), function names (`runDirectAgent`), identifiers, and code-level references
- Server-side auto-extraction (`extractSessionToKnowledge` → DeepSeek) follows the same convention; if you see a row that's just a one-line headline, it predates this rule

The detailed prose history continues below the table — keep both. The table is the at-a-glance index; prose entries are optional for small builds.

## Backlog & task workflow

**Task model:**
- `docs/backlog.json` stores global + per-project tasks with fields: number, title, description, category, priority, status, plan, proofUnits, branch, pr_url, impact
- **Valid status values** (enum): `backlog`, `planned`, `build-started`, `build-finished`, `cba-complete`, `pr-reviewed`, `codex-reviewed`, `review-passed`, `review-blocked`, `staged`, `production`, `failed-smoke-test`, `stalled`, `failed`, `blocked`, `on-hold`, `cancelled` — plus legacy UI statuses `ready`, `in-progress`, `complete`, `cba-half-complete`, `smoke-tested`. *Note: `in-review` is NOT a valid status — do not use it.*
  - `pr-reviewed` — set by `/review-pr` after Claude review is captured (regardless of outcome)
  - `codex-reviewed` — set by `/codex-review` after Codex review is captured (regardless of outcome)
  - `review-passed` — set by orchestrator approval handler after both reviews approve; triggers merge directive
  - `review-blocked` — set by orchestrator approval handler after both reviews run and at least one found blockers; clears back to `build-finished` after fixes are committed
  - `staged` — **CareGuide only** — set after PR merges to the stage branch; not used in Polaris pipeline
  - `stalled` — set by the LangGraph executor (`backlog_sync.py`) when a task times out waiting at a human gate
  - `failed` — generic terminal failure before production (distinct from `failed-smoke-test` which fires after deployment)
- **Status lifecycle for skill-driven workflows:** `backlog` → `planned` (after `/plan-task`) → `build-started` (after `/start-build`) → `cba-complete` (after `/cross-boundary-audit`, mid-build) → `build-finished` (after `/finish-build`) → `pr-reviewed` (after `/review-pr`) → `codex-reviewed` (after `/codex-review`) → `review-passed` or `review-blocked` (after orchestrator approval handler) → `production` (after `/promote-to-prod`). **CareGuide only:** `review-passed` → `staged` (after `/promote-stage`) → `production`.
- **failed-smoke-test status (manual):** Set manually when smoke tests fail after production deployment. No skill automatically transitions to this state. When opening a session with a task in `failed-smoke-test` state, the first action must ask the user: "How did this task fail smoke testing?" (capture failure details, remediation steps, whether rollback or fix is needed).
- **Impact field** (task #19): enum `minor|standard|major` gates planning depth. Minor = skip `/plan-task`. Major = break into subtasks.
- **Proof units** (task #11): each task plan includes `proofUnits[]` array defining TDD proof expectations (failing → passing test per unit)
- Registry audit: `/cross-boundary-audit` verifies all task field producers/consumers, updates registry line refs, checks proof units
- Review workflow: `/review-pr` (Claude) reviews and sets status to `pr-reviewed`; `/codex-review` (Codex) reviews and sets status to `codex-reviewed`; orchestrator approval handler (PHASE 6C) then sets `review-passed` (both approve) or `review-blocked` (at least one blocks)

**Key workflows (stored in `~/.claude/commands/`):**
- `/plan-task` — Interview phase, design outline, proof-unit breakdown, reachability check; plan completion sets status to `planned`
- `/start-build` — Load task plan + proof units, create branch, sync main; **sets status to `build-started`**
- `/finish-build` — Verify proof trail + registries, commit, push, open PR to `main` (Polaris) or `stage` (CareGuide only), record PR URL; **sets status to `build-finished`**
- `/review-pr` — Structured review against spec + registries + diff, proof-trail checklist; **sets status to `pr-reviewed`**
- `/codex-review` — Independent Codex review, compare against prior `/review-pr`; **sets status to `codex-reviewed`**
- `/promote-stage` — **CareGuide only** — looks for `review-passed` tasks, merges approved PRs into stage branch, rollup audit; **sets status to `staged`**
- `/promote-to-prod` — Looks for `review-passed` (Polaris) or `staged` (CareGuide) tasks, promotes to main → prod, watches deploy; **flips to `production`**
- `/ship-task` — Orchestrates the workflow from plan through promotion; does not change status itself (other skills do)

**Proof trail verification:**
- Build evidence: failing test → implement → passing test (RED→GREEN per proof unit)
- Registry evidence: `/cross-boundary-audit` confirms all new identifiers in registries with correct line refs
- Waiver path: if no automated test possible, document manual steps + Scott sign-off instead
- Hard-fail: missing proof units in backlog.json, stale registry line refs, unexplained out-of-scope diff

## Coding discipline
General behavior rules, subordinate to the Polaris-specific rules above. Adapted from `multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills` `CLAUDE.md`:

- Think before coding. State assumptions, surface tradeoffs, and ask when the request has multiple plausible interpretations.
- Prefer the minimum code that solves the problem. Do not add features, abstractions, flexibility, or configuration that were not requested.
- Keep changes surgical. Do not improve adjacent code, comments, formatting, or unrelated dead code unless asked.
- Match the existing style, even when another style seems better.
- Clean up only the unused imports, variables, functions, or files created by your own changes.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.
- Define success criteria before multi-step work. For bugs, reproduce the failure before fixing when practical; for refactors, verify behavior before and after.
- Loop until the goal is verified, and report any verification that could not be completed.
